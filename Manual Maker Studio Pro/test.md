##Welcome##

##What’s new in ScopeBox 3##

ScopeBox 3 takes the market-leading feature set of ScopeBox 2, and adds a host of new features and enhancements. While introduced here, refer to the appropriate sections later in the manual for a more thorough explanation.

###Fail-Safe Capture###

Fail-Safe Capture gives you unparalleled peace of mind during the capture process. Whether you lose power, have a system glitch or just knock a cable loose, Fail-Safe Capture ensures that you’re always left with a playable movie.

###Alerts and Logging###

Alerts let you set threshold values for all of the key aspects of your video and audio signals - exposure values, peak levels, etc. No need to worry about always keeping an eye on your scopes. Even better, the alerts can be exported for easy correction during post production.

###Adaptive Kernel Engine###

ScopeBox 3 is all-new behind the scenes. The Adaptive Kernel Engine optimizes each palette as it’s opened, tuning it to the exact specifications of your individual Mac. With ScopeBox 3, you can be certain that you’re using every bit of performance your machine offers.

###Transcoded Recording###

Most video capture devices (PCI cards, Thunderbolt boxes, etc) deliver uncompressed video to your computer. Unless you’ve got a serious RAID array, capturing uncompressed video is usually out of the question. ScopeBox 3 adds realtime transcoding to records, so you can capture directly to popular formats like Apple ProRes and Avid DNxHD.

###Channel Plot Palette###

The new Channel Plot palette gives you flexibility to monitor how your signal will map between the YCbCr and RGB colorspaces.


#**2** Getting Started#

##Installing##

ScopeBox is a self-contained application. Just drag and drop the application to your Applications folder or any other location on your hard disk, and you’re ready to start using it.

Some input devices may need additional software installed to work with ScopeBox. For example, HDV and DVCProHD cameras will not work without the addition of decoders for those formats. These components are installed with Final Cut Studio. Other devices such as capture cards require drivers provided by their manufacturers.

As a rule of thumb, if your device works with other QuickTime applications, it should work within ScopeBox.

##Uninstalling##

If you want to uninstall ScopeBox, simply drag the application to the trash.
ScopeBox stores its preferences in a file named “com.divergentmedia.scopebox.plist” in your &lt;username&gt;/Library/Preferences/ folder. Layouts and saved source settings are stored in &lt;username&gt;/Library/ Application Support/.


##Registering##

When you first launch ScopeBox, it will run as ScopeBox Lite. To enable the full feature set of ScopeBox, you must enter a serial num- ber in the Registration dialog.
